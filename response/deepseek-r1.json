                "reasoning_content": "We are given an image of a mathematical formula. The formula appears to be a fraction in which the numerator is the sum of two terms and the denominator is the sum of two other terms. The first term in the numerator is the integral from 0 to infinity of e to the power of (-a^2 * x^2) dx. The second term in the numerator is the integral from 0 to infinity of e to the power of (-b^2 * x^2) dx. The denominator is the integral from 0 to infinity of e to the power of (-a^2 * x^2) times e to the power of (-b^2 * x^2) dx.\n\nHowever, note that the formula in the image is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} d x + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}} d x}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}} d x}\n\\]\n\nBut observe that the denominator has a single exponential term that is the product of the two exponentials? Actually, note that the denominator is written as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}} d x\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(a^2 + b^2) x^2} dx\n\\]\n\nWe know that the Gaussian integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-c x^{2}} d x = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{c}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we can compute each integral.\n\nLet I(c) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-c x^{2}} dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{c}}\n\nSo the numerator is:\nI(a^2) + I(b^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a^2}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{b^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} \\right)\n\nThe denominator is:\nI(a^2 + b^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a^2 + b^2}}\n\nSo the fraction becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a^2 + b^2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{a+b}{ab} \\right) }{ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a^2+b^2}} } = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} (a+b)}{ab} }{ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} } = \\frac{a+b}{ab} \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a+b}{ab} \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nBut note that the problem asks for the LaTeX code of the formula in the image, not the simplified form. So we should write the original formula as it appears.\n\nHowever, the image shows the formula with the integrals. Let's write that in LaTeX.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}  dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}\n\\]\n\nBut note: in the denominator, the two exponentials are written separately. We can also write them as a single exponential, but the image shows them as two.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the denominator as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx\n\\]\n\nwhich is the same as above.\n\nSo the LaTeX code for the given formula is:\n\n\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}  dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}\n\nHowever, note that in the image, the differential 'dx' is written without a space. Also, the exponentials are written with the exponent in curly braces? Actually, in the image, the exponents are written without curly braces for the entire exponent, but we should use curly braces for clarity and to ensure correctness.\n\nBut looking at the image, the exponents are: for the first integral, the exponent is `-a^{2} x^{2}`. However, note that in the image, it's written as `-a^{2} x^{2}` which might be interpreted as `-a^2 x^2` without braces. But to be safe, we can use braces for the entire exponent if it is more than one character. However, in the image, the exponent is `-a^{2} x^{2}` which is two terms. Actually, it is written as a single exponent: `-a^2 x^2`? \n\nLooking closely, the expression is `e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}` meaning the exponent is `-a^{2} x^{2}`. But note that without grouping, `a^2 x^2` would be `a^2x^2` which is the same as `a^{2}x^{2}`. So we can write it without extra braces for the entire exponent, but we must have braces for each squared term.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire exponent in one set of braces: `e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}` is the same as `e^{-a^2 x^2}`? Not exactly: the first has two sets of braces, the second has none. But in LaTeX, `e^{-a^2 x^2}` will produce the same as `e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}`? Actually, yes, because without braces, `^` applies to the next single token. So `a^2x^2` is `a^{2}x^{2}`. But to be safe, we can write the entire exponent in one set of braces: `e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}` is the same as `e^{-a^2 x^2}`.\n\nBut in the image, the exponent is clearly `-a^{2} x^{2}`. However, in the denominator, the two exponentials are written as two separate factors: `e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}` and `e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}`. So we write them as two.\n\nSo the LaTeX code is:\n\n```\n\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}  dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}\n```\n\nBut note: the denominator has two exponential factors. We can also write it as `e^{-(a^2+b^2)x^2}`, but the image shows two separate exponentials. So we stick to the image.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the denominator integral might be misinterpreted as having two exponentials multiplied, but that is exactly what it is. So we write it as such.\n\nAlso, note that the image has the differential `dx` at the end of each integral. We write it as `dx`.\n\nTherefore, the final LaTeX code is as above.\n\nBut let's make it more readable by using `\\mathrm{d}x` for the differential? The image uses a regular 'd'. In mathematics, we often use an upright 'd'. However, in the image it is italic. So we can just use `dx`.\n\nAlternatively, in many contexts, the differential is written upright. But the image does not specify. We'll use `dx` as in the image.\n\nSo the code is:\n\n\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}}  dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-a^{2} x^{2}} e^{-b^{2} x^{2}}  dx}\n\nBut note: the exponentials in the denominator are adjacent, so we can write them without a space. However, in LaTeX, it will render the same.\n\nWe can also write the denominator as `e^{-a^{2}x^{2}} e^{-b^{2}x^{2}}` without the space, but the space doesn't matter in LaTeX.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire denominator integrand as `e^{-a^{2}x^{2}} \\cdot e^{-b^{2}x^{2}}`? But the image does not have a dot. So we just write them adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the LaTeX code is as above."
